<h1>How to handle Karma+Jasmine in alg.cubing.net</h1>

<p>We've implemented some unit tests within the system, and these help us stay sane.
Here are some steps to get you running to this point: http://i.imgur.com/HPpPkFa.png</p>

<p>First, have NodeJs installed on your machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>see <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> for most details of how to install.</li>
<li>If you're on Windows, I highly recommend using Chocolatey in general, because it's awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have node installed, open up your command prompt equivalent.</p>

<p>Type this:
    npm install karma karma-jasmine karma-chrome-launcher -g</p>

<p>Then, navigate your prompt to your alg.cubing.net folder</p>

<p>Finally, type 
    karma start testing/karma.conf.js</p>

<p>That's it. Google for more.</p>
